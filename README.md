# PLAYGROUND

The Playground is a space where I experiment with UI/UX concepts and animation techniques. Here, you'll find interactive experiences that showcase my creativity and ability to build engaging interfaces.

Built with Next.js for a performant web experience, I leverage Framer Motion and GSAP to create smooth and dynamic animations.

Explore the Playground to see clones of award-winning websites, interactive experiments, and get a glimpse into my journey with web animations. New creations are added regularly, so be sure to check back often!
